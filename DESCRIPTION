Description: The purpose of the functions implemented in this package is to find a subset containing the weakest species with some acceptable certainty. Suppose we have sampled some quality measures T_{k,j} (>=0) from K species (k=1,...,K, j=1,...,m_k= sample size of kth species), and wish to find the species with the smallest alpha quantile (say, 5th percentile) of T (namely the weakest species). Due to the small sample size (m_k) or large number of species to be considered (K), we might not be able to select a single species as a weakest one with acceptably large certainty. Instead of selecting a single species with a low certainty, we propose to select a subset of species which contains the weakest species with predetermined certainty.
